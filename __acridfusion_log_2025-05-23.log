May 22 20:05:44 <acridfusion>	hi there
May 22 20:06:27 <wm>	Here's a nifty link for you: https://mircscripts.info/

May 22 20:07:04 <acridfusion>	did you see ben shapiro destry's kanye's new song on youtube about 8 days ago
May 22 20:07:11 <acridfusion>	comments are hillarious
May 22 20:08:20 <wm>	Indeed. The slow painful death of The Daily Wire is hard to watch.
May 22 20:08:44 <acridfusion>	i like how grok is interactive on x
May 22 20:09:17 <wm>	Yes sir. Especially that thread about some screenshot a game company shared. The image editor is world class, but it still sucks balls at text generation. 
May 22 20:09:24 <wm>	They also rolled out an official bot on Telegram
May 22 20:09:25 <acridfusion>	you can have grok add shit to pictures people share like "@grok add a mexican woman selling fruit in the background.
May 22 20:10:04 <wm>	Yessir. The way elon teased the feature was amazing. He shared old pictures of Stalin who had images edited way back then. He would have people removed that he killed xD. 
May 22 20:10:45 <wm>	I had it do some stuff with an image of me, but the slight modifcation to my eyes made it hard to look at in a way. But the complete disregard of copyright stuff is nice.
May 22 20:11:09 <wm>	I just wish you could bake it into Firefox the way you can with ChatGPT
